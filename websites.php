    <h1>Website Design</h1>
    <div id="wrapper">
        <h2>Other sites I've made:</h2>
        <p>All my sites are created by hand-coding - without using tools such as Frontpage or Dreamweaver - with an
            emphasis on semantic markup and clutter-free design. This results in clean code that will load faster and
            more consistently across all browsers and platforms. All feature CSS-based layout for compatibility with
            future browser versions and easy maintainability. What does all that mean? That any site I make will look
            consistent, whatever web browser you use. (Except for Internet Explorer 6 and under - I don't code for that
            browser any more. See <a href="advice.php#IE6">here</a>.).</p>

                for an electrical business in Acworth, GA. Clean and simple to use. I copied an olive green color from
                his business card and used it as the color base for the site. Flexible layout, as opposed to
                fixed-width. CSS based, very clean, semantic code. A very robust design, yet easy to work on.</p></div>
