        <h2>THIS IS A SCAM!</h2>
        <p>This one works just like Antivirus 2009 discussed on another page <a href="av2009.php">here</a>.</p>
        <p>It starts, as they almost always do, when you click a link without knowing what it is or where it will take
            you. The page that comes up looks like this:</p>
        <img src="images/SecurityTools2010/security-tool2010_main.png" width="800" height="582"
             alt="Screenshot from phony Security Tools 2010 virus scan hoax">
        <p>It appears to be scanning your computer. And boy, what a fast little scanner it is! Since when does a full
            computer virus scan take about ten seconds?</p>
        <p>(One big tipoff for me is that I'm seeing all this activity while running the Linux operating system, which
            unlike Windows, doesn't even <em>have</em> a C: drive, or a D: drive, or a Control Panel, or a My Documents
            folder, etc, etc.)</p>
        <p>When it's done, you see this little fella pop up:</p>
        <img src="images/SecurityTools2010/security-tool2011_popup.png" width="458" height="231"
             alt="Screenshot from phony Security Tools 2010 virus scan hoax">
        <p>&ldquo;Your computer remains infected by viruses! They can cause data loss and file damages[sic] and need to
            be cured as soon as possible. Return to System Security and download it secure[sic] to your PC&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Sure, ok. :-)</p>
        <p>Now, whatever you click next, you see this:</p>
        <img src="images/SecurityTools2010/security-tool2012_warning.png" width="453" height="345"
             alt="Screenshot from phony Security Tools 2010 virus scan hoax">
        <p>&ldquo;To help protect your computer, Windows Web Security has detected trojans and ready to remove them
            [sic].&rdquo;</p>
        <p>This is supposed to be a listing of all the malware found specifically on YOUR computer, in YOUR home. But
            the fact is, whoever goes to this page, with whatever computer, they'll see the same thing. It's an image, a
            gif, named "alert.gif" and located in the "images" folder on the site. I have a copy of it <a
                    href="images/SecurityTools2010/alert.gif">here</a>.</p>
        <p>At this point, wherever you click next, your browser will attempt to download the true malware:</p>
        <img src="images/SecurityTools2010/security-tool2013_download.png" width="430" height="243"
             alt="Screenshot from phony Security Tools 2010 virus scan hoax">
        <p>In this case it was an executable called "install.exe", 1 megabyte in size. That's just big enough to contain
            a script that starts downloading more malware behind the scenes while it hounds you for money and throws
            popups all over your screen. It is probably not big enough to contain any genuine virus scan-and-removal
            tool.</p>
        <p>Don't be a sucker. If something you've never heard of or asked for says that it's scanning your computer from
            a web page, just close it immediately and don't go back to that site.</p>
