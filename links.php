                <dd>Fragmented file systems are a fact of life for Windows users. Remember <a
                            href="http://thomascomputerrepair.com/faq.php#q6">all those files on top of that desk I
                        talked about?</a> Well, when Windows puts all those files back into its filing cabinet, it
                    doesn't pay much attention to the order it's placing them in there. It more or less puts your files
                    wherever they'll fit. And your files may have grown or shrunk while you worked on them in RAM. Some
                    new files may have been placed where old ones used to reside. Large files may be stored in pieces on
                    different areas of the disk. And so on.
                </dd>
                <dd>The result is "fragmentation". If your files aren't in order, it will take longer for the computer
                    to find them, read them and write to them. Defragmenting sort of puts your files back in order while
                    also scooting them closer to each other, reducing the space between them and "compacting" them. This
                    is a simplified version, but you get the idea.
                </dd>
                <dd>All versions of Windows have come with some sort of defragmenter, but the newest versions included
                    with Vista and 7 don't even have a graphical display of activities. They're slow, too. This free
                    defragmenter from <a href="http://www.auslogics.com/">Auslogics</a> has a nice display reminiscent
                    of Windows 98-era Disk Defragmenter (itself a version of Norton Speed Disk). It runs much faster
                    than Microsoft's defragger, and is more configurable.

                    made this into a bit of a resource hog, and an error-prone one at that. Instead, I recommend:

                <dd>The King of Browsers and my personal favorite! This is the one the others are still trying to catch

                    duplicate via various "extensions". Built-in mail/news client, built-in RSS, IRC chat, mouse
                    gestures, handy note keeper, session manager, site-specific preferences, totally customizable
                    search, Dragonfly (for web development)... it is incredible, the wealth of features that come
                    out-of-the-box with this program (in a download smaller than either Firefox or IE). It also renders
                    HTML and CSS more consistently and accurately than any other browser I've used. This one is probably
                    better suited for power users, though. Of course it's free.

                    business. You accomplish this by substituting your ISP's DNS servers with theirs. Your ISP's DNS
                    servers were set up by your ISP, and you probably never heard anything about it. DNS is supposed to
                    be transparent to you, so don't be concerned if it doesn't sound familiar. But using your ISP's DNS
                    servers gives you no control over Web content. By changing to OpenDNS, you have great control over
                    the content that is allowed into your home or office network. I've outlined the process <a

                    you need help with it, give me a call.)

                <dd>If you "instant message" regularly, then you're aware that some people use Yahoo's service, others
                    use MSN's, and others prefer AOL's. Then there are ICQ and IRC users. If you have "buddies" on more
                    than one of these, you have to install a separate program for each service. Not only that, but these
                    programs throw advertising in your face, and AOL's program forces you to install WeatherBug - which
                    also has advertisements and can slow down your system!<br>Uninstall all of them and get <a
