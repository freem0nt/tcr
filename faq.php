        <div class="col_3">
            <p class="question" id="q1"><span>Q</span>Should I upgrade my computer or just buy a new one?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span>A</span>This is too general a question to answer with a simple yes or no. It depends
                on several things - not least, what specifically you want to upgrade. The first thing I would ask is the
                age of the computer. I might want to know what it cost you. If it's a ten year old clunker, just replace
                the thing and donate your old one to the local library. Computers used to be expensive, but that isn't
                the case any more. It's not uncommon nowadays to find brand new computers - perfectly capable machines -
                on sale for $300. Paying someone to upgrade your hard drive and memory can possibly approach that
                figure. What makes more sense to you?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col_3">
            <p class="question" id="q2"><span>Q</span>Should I switch to Linux?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span>A</span>Probably not. If you're used to Windows, and you consider yourself "computer
                illiterate", then Linux is not for you. There will be a steep learning curve as you have to learn new
                ways of installing software, for instance. Also, if you've become dependent on commercial software like
                Microsoft Office, TurboTax, and other programs that you can buy in the store (including games), and you
                are not interested in learning new ways of getting your work done, be aware that most commercial
                software will not run on Linux. On the other hand, if all you ever do is email and look at websites,
                it's possible that you could start using Linux tomorrow and never miss Microsoft's products.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col_3">
            <p class="question" id="q3"><span>Q</span>Are peer-to-peer file sharing programs like Limewire and Bearshare
                safe to use?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span>A</span>Not really. For one, when someone uses such a program to download and share
                copyrighted music and video, they are breaking the law. Also, these programs usually come bundled with
                spyware and adware. And just because a file is named "popularsong.mp3" doesn't mean that it is actually
                that song. Anyone can name a virus-infected file "popularsong.mp3" and offer it for download. In other
                words, it is very, very common for people to unwittingly download viruses and malware to their computers
                when they think that they're only downloading music. I see this <em>all the time!</em></p>
            <p>If you don't understand why it is a bad idea to download an mp3 that is named after a popular song, but
                is only 25 kb in size, you should not use a file sharing program. If you don't understand what that last
                sentence means, you <em>definitely</em> should not use a file sharing program. You will almost certainly
                download malware to your computer.</p>

            <p class="question" id="q4"><span>Q</span>Aren't expensive antivirus programs like Norton and McAfee better
                than the freebies?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span>A</span>No. Don't believe their hype.</p>
            <p>Companies like McAfee would convince you that in order to be "safe", you need to install their suite of
                ten different programs, including antivirus, antispyware, antispam, antiscam, "SiteAdvisor", et cetera.
                All that junk is going to slow your computer noticeably, I can almost guarantee it. These security
                software companies will convince you that Internet cookies are evil incarnate and can eat your brain.

            <p class="question" id="q5"><span>Q</span>A friend said that if I get more memory, I can save more stuff to
                my computer. Is that true?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span>A</span>Your friend is confusing memory with storage. If you add more
                <em>storage</em> to your computer, then yes, you will be able to save more stuff.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col_3">
            <p class="question" id="q6"><span>Q</span>What's the difference between memory and storage?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span>A</span>Imagine going to work and pulling from a filing cabinet all the files that
                you will need to work with that day. You spread all your files out onto the top of your desk. From your
                desktop, you read them, make changes to them, rename them, etc. You may create some new files on your
                desk. You retrieve other files as you need them from your filing cabinet and lay them onto your desk.
                When you're done working on your files, you place all of them back into your filing cabinet, leaving the
                surface of your desk clean.</p>
            <p>Your filing cabinet is <em>storage</em>. The top of your desk is <em>memory</em>. A computer uses hard
                disk drives for storage and <abbr class="tooltip" title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> for memory.
                When you start your computer, it copies the files it needs in order to run your programs from the hard
                disk to memory, where it can work with them much, much faster. When you shut the computer down,
                everything is moved from memory back to the hard drive for keeping.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col_3">
            <p class="question" id="q7"><span>Q</span>Will adding more <abbr>RAM</abbr> make my computer faster?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span>A</span>Probably. If your desk had more surface area, you could place more files
                onto it, and work with them more easily because they wouldn't be all mashed together. It's about having
                more space to work with.</p>
            <p>In the Windows XP days, computer companies sold a lot of new computers with insufficient memory, but
                that's not a big problem any more. If your computer seems very slow, memory is an obvious thing to look
                at for speeding it up. I recommend running XP on <em>at least</em> 512 MB of <abbr>RAM</abbr>, Vista on
                at least 3GB and Win7 on at least 2GB. That's <em>at least</em>. If you're looking for a new computer,
                4GB is a good number to look for. Don't buy a new computer that has Vista or 7 with less than 4GB of RAM
                installed, and you should have plenty of RAM for most applications.</p>
            <p>Compulsively adding memory to a computer is not a cure-all, though. Don't expect to change a ten year old
                computer into a speed demon by adding memory.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="question"><span>Q</span>Wow! That really makes sense to me now.</p>
        <p class="answer"><span>A</span>You're welcome!</p>
        <p class="anchor"><a href="#top"><img src="images/up.png" title="Top of page" alt="Top of page"></a></p>
        <div class="col_3">
            <p class="question" id="q8"><span>Q</span>Should I worry about hackers?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span>A</span>Don't lose any sleep worrying about being hacked. If you're just a typical
                home computer user, i.e. you're not <abbr>NASA</abbr> or the World Bank, why is someone going to hack
                you? If I or another competent technician has set up your computer or network, there should be plenty of
                protection in place for your computers. If you are using a router, that is one form of firewall, and the
                software firewall that comes with Windows is another layer of protection. If your accounts are
                passworded as well, and you are not using the default password that came with your router, then a hacker
                has got his work cut out for him. Remotely hacking into a computer is time consuming. Imagine someone
                using all his skill and knowledge to access your home network from afar, just so that he can get into
                your computer and then... then what? Read your email? Look at your pictures? Can you really imagine that
                anyone will go to the trouble? My point is that unless you have sensitive data stored on your computer,
                it's not likely that you'll ever be hacked by anyone who knows what they're doing.</p>
            <p>Software companies want you to be paranoid about things like that so that you'll buy their "protection"
                products. Don't worry about it too much. For your home computer, a properly configured router plus the
                software firewall included in XP <abbr class="tooltip"
                                                       title="Service Pack 2 - This was a large update to Windows XP that you should absolutely have installed when it came out. You probably have it, but if you're not sure, right-click My Computer and click Properties. If you see Service Pack 2 there, you have it.">SP2</abbr>
                and Vista is plenty. If you want to be sure that you're reasonably secure, <a href="contact.php">give me
                    a call</a> and I'll be happy to check it out.</p>

        <div class="col_3">
            <p class="question" id="q9"><span>Q</span>What kind of home computer should I buy?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span>A</span>For just a budget, limited-use home computer, you can wait for Dell to run a
                special and call me to set it up after it arrives. I'll want to uninstall all the superfluous programs
                that they preinstall at the factory, and install free antivirus and antispyware programs. I think that
                Dell still builds pretty good computers.</p>
            <p>New Compaq or HP computers seem to run pretty well too. Truth is, there's not one brand of computer out
                there that is the greatest and always runs without problems. I hate to recommend one or the other,
                because if they send you a lemon, you might blame me! You might wish to have your computer built locally
                by a shop. Expect it to be a little more expensive, but the local service should be better. Just don't
                ever buy a computer from WalMart. The computers I've worked on that came from that store have been the
                worst I've seen. In particular, the power supplies and motherboards that manufacturers use for these
                discount machines seem to die like light bulbs.</p>
            <p>If you're looking to buy, check out <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/hardware/"
                                                      onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank');return false;">pcworld.com's
                    hardware reviews</a> to see what's currently getting high marks. They're probably as reliable a
                source as there is for information like that.</p>
            <p>Whatever you order, remember to demand an <abbr class="tooltip" title="Original Equipment Manufacturer">OEM</abbr>
                copy of your operating system! You're paying for it; part of the cost of that computer is the copy of
                Windows that they install on it. Make sure they include this disk, because they probably won't unless
                you request it specifically. You might need it one day. <em>Don't accept "restore" disks in place of the
                    actual operating system.</em> If they refuse to supply a copy of the operating system that you're
                paying for, do business elsewhere.</p>

            <p class="question" id="q10"><span>Q</span>Why don't you have any of those certifications that IT people
                get?</p>
            <p class="answer"><span>A</span>Here I'll quote a passage from <cite>Start Your Own Computer Business</cite>,
                an invaluable book by <a href="http://www.fonerbooks.com/compbiz.htm"
                                         onclick="window.open(this.href,'_blank');return false;">Morris Rosenthal</a>.
            </p>
            <blockquote><p>How do you establish credentials and why should anybody trust you? Well, it turns out that
                    the best way to convince somebody that you're a computer expert is to show up and do something for
                    them. Outside of the human resources departments of bland companies, nobody knows or cares what an
                    A+ certified technician or a certified Microsoft or Novell engineer is. When you're in business for
                    yourself, people will buy PCs from you because you show up and sell them. Nobody will ask you where
                    you learned to put them together (or to buy them cheap), anymore than you ask the person who comes
                    and installs the phone lines where they learned to do it. It's enough that they show up. In small
                    business, your credentials are your honest face, your word of mouth, your Yellow Pages listing, your
                    website, and your storefront if you have one. You're going to need all the cash you can get your
                    hands on. Don't waste it on pieces of paper that nobody will read to frame and stick on the wall.
                    That's a game for the people who want to be somebody else's employee.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
            <p>I have personally witnessed an <span class="tooltip"
                                                    title="Holders of the A+ certification have been trained in installing, repairing, troubleshooting, maintaining, customizing and operating PCs.">A+ certified</span>
                individual who did not know how to replace a hard drive. I want to believe that the majority of the
                people who have various certifications truly know their stuff, but all certification really proves is
                that they took a difficult multiple-choice exam, and answered correctly a high enough percentage of
                questions in order to pass. As my anecdote demonstrates, there's no substitute for hands-on experience.
            </p>
            <p>The short answer to the question is that I've never taken any of the certification exams. Maybe one day I
                will study up and get the A+ and the <abbr class="tooltip" title="Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer">MCSE</abbr>
                or Linux+. Or maybe not. Certifications are not a priority to me.</p>

            <p><strong>Addendum April 1, 2011:</strong> (No, it's not an April Fool's joke!) While I still stand by my
                position as written above, circumstances have changed. Life changes dictate that I find better full-time
                work, and the only thing employers look for any more is degrees and/or certifications. For this reason,
                I've recently tested for and earned CompTIA A+ certification, and I'm preparing to test for Network+ and
                then Security+ certifications. I'm going to get at least these three. I am also enrolled BACK in school
                to finish up an Associate's, as I've found that mere diplomas from technical schools are all but
                worthless in the real world. That was time well spent.</p>
