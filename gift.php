        <h2>Looking for a great gift to give?</h2>
        <p>Here is what one of my customers gave to her father for his birthday:</p>
        <a style="border-bottom:none;text-decoration:none" href="images/gift_certificate.jpg"><img
                    src="images/gift_certificate_400.jpg" width="400" height="304"
                    alt="Gift certificate for Paul Thomas Computer Repair services"></a>
        <p>It is printed on heavy paper. That is my card at the bottom.</p>
        <p>I didn't have anything to do with this - it was all the client's idea, but I was tickled when I saw it, and
            the father graciously allowed me to have it.</p>
