        <h2>Specs:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dell XPS 630i</li>
            <li>Intel E8400 Core2 Duo Processor, 3GHz, 6MB cache</li>
            <li><span style="text-decoration:line-through;">4GB</span> 8GB DDR2 SDRAM at 800MHz</li>
            <li>Nvidia GeForce 9800GT Graphics Card</li>
            <li>3x 1TB SATA Hard Drives, 64MB Cache</li>
            <li>750W Dell Power Supply</li>
            <li>That's the meat of it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It came with XP Pro installed and one hard drive, so the first thing I did was put in the second and third
            hard drives and install Linux Mandriva 2009 64-bit on one so that I could get up and running. Then after
            partitioning the original drive into two fifty gigabyte NTFS partitions and one huge Linux partition, I
            installed the copy of Vista Ultimate that came with the computer on the partition after XP Pro. Then I
            installed Kubuntu 8.10 on the third drive, just to play around with it. So now this system quadruple-boots
            to either Mandriva 2009, Kubuntu 8.10, Windows XP Professional, or Windows Vista Ultimate.</p>
        <p>Here's the inside &ndash; the pic links to a larger one with labels.</p>

        <p>Here are my two Acer 19" monitors showing my KDE 4 desktop:</p>
        <a href="images/monitors_kde4_new.jpg"><img src="images/tn_monitors_kde4_new.jpg" width="300" height="225"
                                                    alt="Picture of both monitors showing KDE 4"></a>
        <p>Note that the areas on the left monitor that look like file browsers opened in separate windows are actually
            applets - part of the desktop. <a href="http://www.kde.org/whatiskde/">KDE 4</a> is a trip!</p>
        <p><a href="images/desktop_kde4_2.jpg">Here's a screenshot of the whole desktop.</a> There are no open windows
            or shortcut icons on the screen.</p>
        <h2>UPDATE - October 2009</h2>
        <p>My 19" Acers have been replaced by two 24" Dells:</p>

        <p>Here's a screenshot of my current desktop setup. I think it looks nice. This is both screens, each set at
            1920x1080, for a total resolution of 3840x1080. The wallpaper is swiped from a Vista installation and
            stretched to fit.</p>
