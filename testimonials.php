        <h2>Here is what some of my customers have to say:</h2>
        <blockquote class="testimonial"><p>It seems like on my busiest days at work, something is going to go wrong with
                my computer. On more than one occasion, I have frantically picked up the phone and called Paul to help
                figure out "what is going on with these computers!!". <span>He has always been able to respond quickly and resolve my computer problems.</span>
                Because Paul is so dependable and knowledgeable, my husband and I have used his service to fix our
                computers at home as well.</p>

        <blockquote class="testimonial right"><p>I own a spa and salon and I have several computers. Paul has helped me
                to get all of these computers working together and he has also helped me to work from anywhere else by
                networking my laptop computer with work.
                <span>I am no longer spending all of my time in my office.</span> I can work by the pool or at the
                beach. Thank you so much Paul, for everything you've done to help my spa run more smoothly! You're the
                best!</p>

        <blockquote class="testimonial"><p>Paul Thomas has been a life-saver for me this summer. He helped me solve the
                problem with my computer as well as work on my sister's computer when she moved to Warner Robins. <span>I found Paul to be very professional and dedicated to his job.</span>
                He was very patient with me. (I am not a computer person.) Paul was easy to contact and quickly
                responded to my call for help! I think his prices are very reasonable and would highly recommend his
                computer services to everyone!</p>

        <blockquote class="testimonial right"><p>I could tell from the very beginning that Paul Thomas is a very honest
                and professional young man with an endearing quality. He has been to my house on a number of occasions
                and <span>always fixes my computer problems at a very reasonable price.</span> This does not include the
                numerous times that he has resolved my computer problems over the phone, for which he refused
                compensation. On one visit, he doubled my RAM at no extra charge to me which has really speeded things
                up! On another occasion Paul drove to Warner Robins just to get a small piece of hardware that my
                computer needed. I might also add that he is very patient and kind to "airheaded" old folks like me. I
                could never thank him enough for what he has done for me and will always call on him in the future to
                fix my computer problems.</p>

        <blockquote class="testimonial"><p>I have used Paul's services on several occassions. I have a rather complex
                computer setup involving several networked computers, remote logins, simulated static IP address,
                multiple scanners, printers, live cameras, home device control using X10 devices, TV over the internet
                hardware, dual VOIP telephone hardware, multiscreen desktops on each computer. On the software side, I
                use multiple editors and wordprocessors, fax software, scanning software, custom software, web page
                design software, and a considerable amount of alpha and beta test software. When I have needed help Paul
                has always been available and has always been able to fix my problems. In fact, <span>I would rate his services superior to those persons I used prior to moving to Georgia who had Microsoft Certifications.</span>

        <blockquote class="testimonial right"><p>Paul Thomas recently created a website for our company, and we were
                very satisfied with his services. <span>He worked with us step by step,</span> offering great
                suggestions, and was always available for any questions. Because of the wonderful job that he did, we
                will definitely use his services again, and refer others to him.</p>

        <blockquote class="testimonial"><p>Paul Thomas' services are always "top drawer". <span>He can quickly zero in on complex computer problems and resolve them expertly, while explaining each step he takes in resolving them.</span>
                He responds to problems promptly, and it is always a pleasure to receive his assistance and guidance.
                Paul is a gentleman in every respect and I always feel less stressed when I encounter problems, knowing
                that I can depend on his expertise.</p>

        <blockquote class="testimonial right"><p>It's been a real pleasure to have you work on my three computers. I
                want to thank you for the wonderful and thoughtful service you have provided for the past years. Your
                attitude and work are outstanding. The many times I cried "help" and you responded quickly and ALWAYS
                repaired the problems I seem to be able to create. <span>You never made me feel like things were my fault nor that I didn't understand the problem.</span>
                I have recommended you to most of my friends and will not hesitate to give you a high recommendation to
                anyone who asks. Your service is beyond reproach - - your work has been better than anyone could ask - -
                your prices are more than easy on the budget - - Just wanted you to know how much I appreciate you and
                that you are always there and available when I get into trouble.</p>
